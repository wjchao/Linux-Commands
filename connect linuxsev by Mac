Mac terminal can run ssh client
The format of the ssh command is ssh -p port_number username@servername
You can omit -p 22 if the port is assumed 22
The username only needs to be specified if it is different on the serverthan it is on your Mac workstation
For example, 
    ssh linuxsvr
    ssh bob@linuxsvr
    ssh -p 2222 bob@linuxsvr

Problem:
    terminal came back "ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.11 port 22: Connection refused"
solute:
    1.ping 192.168.1.11 see can connect the linuxsvr
    2.check openssh-server installed in that system.
    3.check the status of ssh service, make ssh service start.
        sudo service ssh status    
        sudo service ssh start
    4.Check iptables in that system that port 22 is blocked. Just allow port in iptables and then check.
        sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
    5.Else change port number of ssh from 22 to 2222 by editing
        vi etc/ssh/sshd_config    
        /etc/init.d/ssh restart.
